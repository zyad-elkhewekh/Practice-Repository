# Reflection Questions

Answer these as you go — don't wait until the end. Some answers only exist
*after* you've done a step, so fill this in progressively.

Your answers will be reviewed alongside your code. Generic or copy-pasted
answers (that don't reference your actual output) will be sent back for
revision.

## Part 1 — Before touching anything (after reading CONTRIBUTING.md)

it uses type/description convention, example: docs/my-contributer-name

**2. What commit message format is required? Write the exact commit message
you plan to use for your change.**

> Your answer here.

## Part 2 — After forking and cloning

**4. Paste the output of `git remote -v` from your local clone. Which remote
is `origin` and which is `upstream`, and why does that distinction matter?**

> Your answer here.
```
origin  git@github.com:zyad-elkhewekh/Practice-Repository.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:zyad-elkhewekh/Practice-Repository.git (push)
upstream        git@github.com:IbrahimYasserM/Practice-Repository.git (fetch)
upstream        git@github.com:IbrahimYasserM/Practice-Repository.git (push)
```
`origin` remote is my forked clone and `upstream` is the original,
the distinction matters to allow me to get other changes from the original (aka other peoples forks' changes from their locals) and keep my changes safe

## Part 3 — After making your change

**5. Paste the output of `git log --oneline -3`. Do your commit message(s)
follow the convention from `CONTRIBUTING.md`?**

> Your answer here.
```

3b30f00 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) Clarify task labeling in README
